<h1>Hi, I'm Josiah! <br/><a 
<h2>Welcome to a journey of a Cybersecurity Enthusiast <br/><a 

  ----  
<h2> Biography</h2>
A high school junior passionate about cybersecurity and driven by a family legacy of helping others. Growing up in Georgia, I’ve always had a strong work ethic, balancing my studies, a part-time job, and independent learning. Alongside my academic pursuits, I’ve earned my GIAC Sec+ Foundations certification through a scholarship, building a solid foundation in cybersecurity. I plan to enlist in the army after high school to deepen my expertise, ultimately pursuing a degree in cybersecurity. Through my experiences, I aim to develop skills that will not only protect organizations from cyber threats but also make a positive impact on the broader community.


<h2> Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
My interest in cybersecurity stems from a blend of inspiration and purpose. Coming from a family that values helping others, I see cybersecurity as my way to continue that legacy, but with a technical edge. As technology rapidly evolves, so do the threats it poses to individuals and organizations, making the need for strong digital defenses greater than ever. Cybersecurity allows me to be on the front lines of this effort, using my skills to safeguard sensitive information and protect people from potential harm. It’s this mix of service, challenge, and the ever-evolving nature of cybersecurity that drives my dedication to the field, as I work to create a safer digital world for all.
